# Grade Calculator 🎓

Welcome to the **Grade Calculator** project!  
This Python program takes a student's marks, validates them, assigns a grade (A–F), and displays an encouraging message. It’s designed to strengthen your Python fundamentals with **conditional logic, input validation, functions, and loops**.

---


## 📌 Project Overview
A simple, friendly Python program that takes a student's marks and returns a grade (A–F) with an encouraging message. It demonstrates:
- `if-elif-else` grading logic
- Input validation (0–100 only)
- A `while` loop to re-prompt invalid inputs
- Functions for clean, reusable code
- Clear, welcoming output

---

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
- Practice conditional logic and validation
- Build user-friendly CLI interactions
- Organize code with functions
- Produce submission-ready documentation and screenshots

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions (VS Code)
1. **Install Python** (3.8 or higher).
2. **Create folder**:
3. **Open in VS Code**: File → Open Folder → select `grade-calculator`.
4. **Add files**:
- `grade_calculator.py`
- `README.md`
- `test_cases.txt`
- `screenshots/` (add your PNG screenshots here)
5. **Run the program** in VS Code terminal:
```bash
python grade_calculator.py

## 🧠 Grading Logic

The program assigns grades based on the following rules:

| Marks Range | Grade | Message |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| 90–100      | A     | 🌟 Outstanding work! You’re mastering the material. |
| 80–89       | B     | 👍 Very Good! Keep it up and aim even higher. |
| 70–79       | C     | 💪 Good effort — review a few topics and you’ll level up. |
| 60–69       | D     | 📚 You’re close — focus on weak areas and practice more. |
| 0–59        | F     | 🚀 Don’t be discouraged — seek help, revise, and try again. |
