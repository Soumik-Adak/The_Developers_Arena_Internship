# Grade Calculator 🎓

## 📌 Project Overview
A simple, friendly Python program that takes a student's marks and returns a grade (A–F) with an encouraging message. It demonstrates:
- `if-elif-else` grading logic
- Input validation (0–100 only)
- A `while` loop to re-prompt invalid inputs
- Functions for clean, reusable code
- Clear, welcoming output

---

## 🎯 Goals & Objectives
- Practice conditional logic and validation
- Build user-friendly CLI interactions
- Organize code with functions
- Produce submission-ready documentation and screenshots

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions (VS Code)
1. **Install Python** (3.8 or higher).
2. **Create folder**:
3. **Open in VS Code**: File → Open Folder → select `grade-calculator`.
4. **Add files**:
- `grade_calculator.py`
- `README.md`
- `test_cases.txt`
- `screenshots/` (add your PNG screenshots here)
5. **Run the program** in VS Code terminal:
```bash
python grade_calculator.py

🧠 Grading Logic
- A: 90–100 → 🌟 Outstanding work!
- B: 80–89 → 👍 Very Good!
- C: 70–79 → 💪 Good effort
- D: 60–69 → 📚 Needs improvement
- F: 0–59 → 🚀 Don’t be discouraged

✅ Example Output
Enter student name: Priya
Enter marks (0-100): 85

📊 RESULT FOR PRIYA:
Marks: 85/100
Grade: B
Message: Very Good! Keep it up! 👍



📚 What I Learned
- How to design grading rules with if-elif-else
- How to validate user input using a while loop
- How to encapsulate logic in functions
- How to organize a project with README, test cases, and screenshots

✨ This version is **ready to paste** into your repo. The links will work automatically if the files (`grade_calculator.py`, `test_cases.txt`, and `screenshots/`) are in the same folder structure.  

Would you like me to also add **badges** (Python version, project status, license) at the top of the README to make it look even more polished?
